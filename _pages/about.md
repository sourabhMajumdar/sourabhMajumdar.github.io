Hello, My name is Sourabh Majumdar and I have recently graduated from **Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus** with a bachelors degree in **Computer Science**.

## My Interests

My main area of interest lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Specifically **Artificial General Intelligence**. I believe solving AI would be one of the greatest challenge of humankind. I am currently attempting to solve this problem through exploring the field of **Natural Language Processing**

## My Other Interests

In my leisure time I am an adventurer, usually exploring new places and meeting new people. I like taking hikes in the wilderness and strolling through the streets of busy bazaars.
