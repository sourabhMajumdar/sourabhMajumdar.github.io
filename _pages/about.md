I am currently pursuing my masters degree in **Computer Science** at the **Department of Computer Science, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.**

## My Interests

My main area of interest lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Specifically **Artificial General Intelligence**. I believe solving AI would be one of the greatest challenge of humankind. I am looking forward to solve this problem one challenge at a time.
