This work was done as a part of my summer internship at MT-NLP Lab, Language Technology Research Center, Kohli Center for Intelligent Systems, IIIT-Hyderabad.

The aim of this work was to explore neuralcoreference resolution on NPTEL-Lecture Transcripts provided by MHRD,Govt of India.

We applied State-the-art neuralcoreference models on the lecture transcripts, identified itâ€™s weak points and presented our solution to the problem.
