With the Rise of Deep Learning Systems, there has been an expectation for a new generation
of conversational agents. In this thesis we look at what are the current challenges faced by
todayâ€™s conversational agents, what solutions are proposed in current literature and finally we
propose our own solutions to these challenges. We then test our own deep learning system for
a conversational scenario on a data set we create from scratch. We discuss the strengths and
characteristics of our Data Set and how to interpret and use it for any future line of research.
